## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. it is downloaded from __[Udacity](http://https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv)__  This dataset includes 183412 trips with 16 features such as locations, time, and user attributes. There are start and end stations.


## Summary of Findings

> Univariate exploration: There are more trips in the morning and afternoon than the night. Also, there are more trips during the weekdays and less trips during the weekends. There are more sunscribers than customers. The number of trips in male riders is more than the number of trips in females. Most of riders are 27 to 37 years old and the duration of trips is around 10 mins. Market St at 10th St is the top start point while San Francisco Caltrain Station 2  (Townsend St at 4th St) is the top destination.

Bivariate exploration: there is no significant relationship between trip duration and users age. After separation the top 10 stations, half of stations have the most trips in the morning and another half of stations has the most trips in the afternoon. Weekdays have the most trips than weekends. Females stay longer on the bikes as they have longer trip durations. Subscribers mainly hire a bike during weekdays (more than double), and Customers hire especially in the weekend.

Multivariate exploration: As already established, customers will most likely use the bike service mostly on weekends, while Subscribers will likely have a trip from Monday to Friday during rush hours which shows they are commuters. Customers most likely includes tourists because most trips happen in the weekend. There are more trips in the morning or afternoon no matter in customers or subscribers. Also, the number of trips increases in the tourist attractions like ferry building and Embarcadero.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The stations with the most trips includes Market St at 10th St, San Francisco Caltrain Station 2  (Townsend St at 4th St) and Berry St at 4th St. User types play a key factor on the number of trips in each trip duration, location and time group. For customers, there are more trips in the weekends. On the other hand, for subscribers, there are more trips during the weekdays. Thus, collecting more information individually from these two user types is important for the future analysis. Age also has influenced on the number of rides and also the trip duration as yoounger people between 27 - 37 takes more trips. The females tend tohave have more trip duration than the males even though the males ride more. Also, the number of trips increases in stations like Embarcadero and San Francisco Ferry Building (Harry Bridges Plaza) and it seems they are popular places for customers. This suggests they might be tourist attraction sites.
